I've been coding for just over 5 years now and love the challenge of solving a new problem everyday!

My coding knowledge stems from a combination of university study, self study, and professional experience.

My goal is to create a product that quantitatively improves the lives of millions of users. However, I still have much to learn and would love to bring value to an amazing company in the meantime.
